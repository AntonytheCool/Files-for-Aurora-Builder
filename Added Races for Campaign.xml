				<p>Autognomes are mechanical beings built by rock gnomes. Sometimes, because of a malfunction or a unique circumstance, an autognome becomes separated from its creator and strikes out on its own.</p>
				<h4>BUILT FOR WIMSY</h4>
				<p>An autognome bears a resemblance to its creator, and most autognomes are programmed to speak and understand Gnomish. The internal components used in an autognome’s manufacture can vary wildly; one autognome might have an actual beating heart in its chest cavity, while another might be powered by stardust or intricate clockwork gears.</p>
				<h5>SENTIENT ORIGINS</h5>
				<p>Roll on the Autognome History table or choose an entry that you like to identify what event set you on the path to adventure. If nothing on the table appeals to you, work with your DM to create an origin story for your character.</p>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr><td>d6</td><td>Origin</td></tr>
					</thead>
					<tr><td>1</td><td>Your creator gave you autonomy and urged you to follow your dreams.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>2</td><td>Your creator died, leaving you to fend for yourself.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>3</td><td>A glitch caused you to forget your original programming. You don’t remember who made you or where you came from.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>4</td><td>You didn’t like how you were being treated by your creator, so you ran away from home.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>5</td><td>Your creator built you to complete a special mission.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>6</td><td>You felt trapped in the role for which you were built and abandoned your creator, determined to find a greater purpose.</td></tr>

				<h4>AUTOGNOME TRAITS</h4>
				<p>Your autognome character has the following traits. A few of the traits give you a choice; consider how your choice reflects the purpose for which your character was built.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> You increase one ability score by 2, and one other ability score by 1.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong>Like gnomes, autognomes can live for centuries, typically up to 500 years.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong>Autognomes tend to be built with their own thoughs and opinions seperate from there creators, although their creator and those around them can influence them.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>You are Small.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a construct AND a humanoid.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Built For Success.</em></strong>You can add a d4 to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, and you can do so after seeing the d20 roll but before the effects of the roll are resolved. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mechanical Nature.</em></strong>You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Healing Machine.</em></strong>If the Mending spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). In addition, your creator designed you to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Mass Cure Wounds, Mass Healing Word, and Spare the Dying.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry’s Rest.</em></strong>When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Armored Casing.</em></strong>You are encased in a thin metal or some other durable material. While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Specialized Design.</em></strong>You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common, gnomish, and one other language of your choice.</p>

			<description>

				<h4>DEEP SEA ORIGINS</h4>
				<p>These creatures have just recently risen from the depths of the ocean, and much of their culture is unknown. What is known, however, is that they came from an underwater canyon deep below the surface. They claim to have dug into the sides of the canyon to make crude burrow like dwellings.</p>
				<h4>PHYSIOLOGY</h4>
				<p>Crabfolk are an extremely odd race that tend to be a hodge podge of serveral crustacean traits and appendages, no two crabfolk look exactly alike. the only thing Crabfolk seem to shair universally are eye stalks with large beady eyes, and two smaller clawed arms that used for more delicate things like writing and eating.</p>

	  <element name="Giff" type="Race" source="Homebrew" id="ID_ABCII_HOMEBREW_RACE_GIFF">
			<description>
				<p>Giff are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go. </p>
				<h4>UNKNOWN ORIGINS</h4>
				<p>Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current form.</p>
				<h4>ASTRAL ALLURE</h4>
				<p>Although they don't realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Sea because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.</p>
				<h4>NAMING DISAGREEMENTS</h4>
				<p>Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.</p>
				<h4>GIFF TRAITS</h4>
				<p>Your Giff character has the following racial traits:</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong>Due to there size, giff get 2 points in strength and 1 point in constitution</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong>Giff mature faster than humans, reaching adulthood at 14 and old age at 60. They can live for 90 years.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong>Giff can fall into any alignment depending on there upbringing, they're usually lawful though due to their strict, regimented lifestyle.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>Giff can stand anywhere from 5 to 7 feet, your size is medium</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong>Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Astral Spark.</em></strong>Your psychic connection to the Astral Plane enables you to mystically access a spark of divine power, which you can channel through your weapons. When you hit a target with a simple or martial weapon, you can cause the target to take extra force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you can use it no more than once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Firearm Mastery.</em></strong>You have a mystical connection to firearms that traces back to the gods of the giff, who delighted in such weapons. You have proficiency with all firearms and ignore the loading property of any firearm. In addition, attacking at long range with a firearm doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack roll.</p>		
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hippo Build.</em></strong>You have advantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws. In addition, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other laguage of your choice.</p>

				<description>Your psychic connection to the Astral Sea enables you to mystically access a spark of divine power, which you can channel through your weapons. When you hit a target with a simple or martial weapon, you can cause the target to take extra force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you can use it no more than once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</description>

			<description>
				<p> Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar form, but there’s little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else.</p>
				<h5>STRANGE BIOLOGY</h5>
				<p>They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores. Plasmoids don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves called ganglia. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound. When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.</p>
				<h5>ODD ORIGINS</h5>
				<p>Where the plasmoids originated from is unknown, ask anyone whos lived on the seas and most will say they just showed up oneday. Even plasmoids themselves aren't too certain of where they come from, with most saying that they don't have much recollection of their earlier years.</p>
				<h4>PLASMOID TRAITS</h4>

	<element name="Thri-Kreen" type="Race" source="Homebrew" id="ID_ABCII_HOMEBREW_RACE_THR-KREEN">
		<description>
			<p>Thri-kreen have insectile features and two pairs of arms. Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings.</p>
			<h5>PSIONIC COMMUNICATION</h5>
			<p>Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.</p>
			<h4>THRI-KREEN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your thri-kreen character has the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or strength score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong>Thri-kreen live much shorter lives than their humanoids counterparts. A thri-kreen matures quickly, reaching adulthood within 3-4 years of hatching. Most thri-kreen only live to be 30 years old, although some live marginally longer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Thri-kreen, to many people's surprise, tend towards no particular alignment. Some are lawful if they come from a hive or a colony, following a rigorous social hierarchy set upon them since coming out the egg. Others tend to be chaotic, uncomfortable living by the societal standards the other races subject themselves to, often finding themselves acting in whatever fashion benefits them at the time. Regardless of this, it is rare that Thri-Kreen are good and evil.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> A full-grown thri-kreen stands six feet tall but can be as long as 6 to 8 feet, and can weigh between 100 to 375 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet and your hovering speed is half of your walking speed. You sink in liquid and have a swimming speed of 0 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dark Vision.</em></strong> Your compact eyes and deep instincts give you superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Exoskeleton.</em></strong> You have a natural external covering for support and protection. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Extra Arms.</em></strong> You have four arms, your two regular arms and two smaller arms that are closer to the center of the chest. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Thri-Kreen Weapon Training.</em></strong> The thri-kreen are known for their martial prowess with the chatkcha and gythka. You have proficiency with the dagger, spear, pike, and glaive.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flight.</em></strong> You have a flying speed that is half of your walking speed. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hive Link.</em></strong> With the assistance of your psionic abilities, you are able to work around your mandibles in order to communicate with others unlike your own. You have the ability to speak telepathically to any and all creatures within 60 feet of you regardless of shared languages. You can't learn or speak any other languages</p>
